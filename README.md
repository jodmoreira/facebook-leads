# Script to download data from all forms from a Facebook page.
## works on 8.0 API version

Create a Facebook App to get a Page Access Token and connect to a Facebook Page.
It requires the following permissions:
pages_show_list, leads_retrieval, pages_read_engagement, pages_manage_ads
You may want to custom the code to get data from different fields created by you. Be my guest :P
Enjoy!
